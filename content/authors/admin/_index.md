 My name is Maria.

I am a travel and tourism specialist and parallel to my carrer I developed an interest in visual arts especially involving the use of materials that can be molded in three dimensions. I work in a variety of mediums and with various techniques and I translates reality by re-elaborating images via my art.

My work describes my state of mind in a specific moment and at the same time I finds encourgement to put life into perspective.

In the past my work has been chosen by the global company adidas and exhibited in their store in Covent Garden, London, 10,000 copies of the  Bristol Pound poster I designed have been distributed in the UK, and my artwork ‘Europe’ was exhibited at the European Parliament in Brussels.

I am open to meningful exchange an collaboration, get in touch!

Ciao, Maria

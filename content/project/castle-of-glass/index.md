This castle of glass is designed to represent from a skyscraper height the view of a cityscape composed by dusty districts.
This imaginary dark and foggy city defines the mood and character of our modern world, the struggle of life and the human heart&soulâ€™s fragility.

The castle rising above is reflecting the light like a glittering crystal as the symbol of strength, power and lightness however the reality is that like the rest of the world it will be falling apart and crumble.

summary: >-
  Slogans of protest and political or social commentary graffiti on walls are
  the precursor to modern graffiti and street art, and continue as one aspect of
  the genre. Street art in the form of text or simple iconic graphics of
  corporate icons can become well-known yet enigmatic symbols of an area or an
  era.[\[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art#cite_note-Village_Voice_Mott-8)
  Some credit the *[Kilroy Was
  Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilroy_Was_Here "Kilroy Was Here")*
  graffiti of the World War II era as one such early example; a simple
  line-drawing of a long-nosed man peering from behind a ledge. Author [Charles
  Panati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Panati "Charles Panati")
  indirectly touched upon the general appeal of street art in his description of
  the "Kilroy" graffiti as "outrageous not for what it said, but where it turned
  up".[\[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art#cite_note-Kilroy-9) Much
  of what can now be defined as modern street art has well-documented origins
  dating from [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New
  York City")'s [graffiti
  boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_in_the_United_States "Graffiti in
  the United States"), with its infancy in the 1960s, maturation in the 1970s,
  and peaking with the spray-painted full-car subway train murals of the 1980s
  centered in [the Bronx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx "The Bronx").


  As the 1980s progressed, a shift occurred from text-based works of early in the decade to visually conceptual street art such as [Hambleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hambleton "Richard Hambleton")'s shadow figures.[\[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art#cite_note-10) This period coincides with [Keith Haring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Haring "Keith Haring")'s subway advertisement subversions and [Jean-Michel Basquiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat "Jean-Michel Basquiat")'s [SAMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMO "SAMO") tags. What is now recognized as "street art" had yet to become a realistic career consideration, and offshoots such as [stencil graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_graffiti "Stencil graffiti") were in their infancy. [Wheatpasted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyposting "Flyposting") poster art used to promote bands and the clubs where they performed evolved into actual artwork or copy-art and became a common sight during the 1980s in cities worldwide.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*] The group working collectively as [AVANT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVANT "AVANT") was also active in New York during this period.[\[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art#cite_note-11) Punk rock music's subversive ideologies were also instrumental to street art's evolution as an art form during the 1980s. Some of the anti-museum mentality can be attributed to the ideology of [Marinetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti") who in 1909 wrote the "[Manifesto of Futurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto_of_Futurism "Manifesto of Futurism")" with a quote that reads, "*we will destroy all the museums*."[\[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art#cite_note-:0-12) Many street artists claim we do not live in a museum so art should be in public with no tickets.[\[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_art#cite_note-:0-12)

Street art has evolved from the early forms of defiant [graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti "Graffiti") into a more commercial form of art, as one of the main differences now lies with the messaging. Street art is often meant to provoke thought rather than rejection among the general audience through making its purpose more evident than that of graffiti. The issue of permission has also come at the heart of street art, as graffiti is usually done illegally, whereas street art can nowadays be the product of an agreement or even sometimes a commission. However, it remains different from traditional art exposed in public spaces by its explicit use of said space in the conception phase.
